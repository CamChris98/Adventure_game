# Adventure_game
## Overview
This program is a simple text adventure game that i wrote in C#, the game follows a small story and goes until the player loses all their health, and the score will be displayed at game over. 

This program was written with the purpose of showing familiarity with the C# language, in using many different parts of the language and syntax like using variables, expressions, loops, functions, classes, and structures and unions. 

## My demonstration of the program:

## Development Environment
I used the Visual Studio IDE to develop this project. 

This program was written in the C# language and there was no other library accessed to complete the program.

## Future Work
### work that could be done in the future to improve this project would include:
* implementing a save function that would save the progress to a file
* keep the text based system but incorporate a GUI to give visuals to the game and make it more appealing
* add more classes like enemy classes, weapon classes to give different attack values, a shop to allow the user to spend their points theyve earned.
